# This is a config template.
#
# It can be stored as user config file under ~/.slack-clusterbot and / or
# system-wide. By default, clusterbot searches the default location
# /etc/slack-clusterbot for the system config file. This can be changed by
# setting the ``system_config_file`` option in the user config file or passing
# it as parameter at ``ClusterBot`` initialization.
#
# Config options passed as ``ClusterBot`` initalization always overwrite
# options from the user config file which overwrites options from the system
# config file.
